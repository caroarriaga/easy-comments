# Easy comments
## what is it?
Easy comments helps teachers provide specific feedback to their students.

## How does it work?
### Data input
You will need to have data from your students in a google sheet.
Currently, it will import the first six columns in the file.
Use the [template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u_fKROXhxEU8M42XfM6mdm0gbkOiCi8nmrg6fgCabVE/edit#gid=0) for the app to work properly.

Template:
Col 1: Student ID
Col 2: First term grade
Col 3: Second term grade
Col 4: First Name
Col 5: Last Name
Col 6: Grade level

Once you have it in this format, you can paste the gsheet link to the sidebar.

### Ratings
The teacher can easily provide different rating, feedback, and custom comments to the student.

## Output
Once all the values are input, click "Create comment" and an AI teacher assistant will create a summary of all the data.
